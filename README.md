# WordPress Instagram Twitter Bridge

Twitter offers ["Cards"](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image) that will preview links that you share inside tweets. If the website that your link points to supports Twitter Cards, then the link will be displayed with a title, short summary of the content and a thumbnail.

Unfortunately, Instagram does not support Twitter Cards. If you share an Instagram image on Twitter, it will be shown as a completely plain link box in your feed.

WordPress Instagram Twitter Bridge is a WordPress plugin that lets you create links to Instagram posts that will show as nicely formatted Cards in your feed. It basically adds Twitter Card support to Instagram via your website.
